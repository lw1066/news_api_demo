# news_api_demo

This news API demo uses a PSQL database and node-postgres. 

To use it you will need to install dotenv and add a .env file for a test (.env.test) or development (.env.development) database.

Both .env files need the PG database name: PGDATABASE=*your database name here* and may also need your  PG password: PGPASSWORD=*your password here*.
